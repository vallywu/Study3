Plotting Functions
-------------------

Throughout the toolbox, care has been taken to present results and project analyses into outputs of a form directly interpretable by the analyst, such as projecting the loadings of a multivariate model onto the spectrum in the case of NMR, and as an ion-map for LC-MS. 

See the :doc:`Plot Gallery<plotsGallery>` for a visual overview of the available plots.
